# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
Uses Python and the rubik-solver package to solve a virtual Rubiks Cube. This was for the SSMIF Quant coding challenge.

As it turns out, importing a solving algorithm package was discouraged. I'm personally not at a point in which I could code an effective solving algorithm for a Rubiks Cube; hell, I don't even know how to solve a Rubiks Cube. I've never touched one before this challenge. However, I found a lot of value in the problem solving behind coding this program and the practice with manipulating matrices to accurately mimic a cube, so I'm still happy with this program despite potential point deductions. Also, getting the final output was beyond satisfying.
